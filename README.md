# Gesture & Audio Reactive Particle Tool

Interactive 3D particle playground **built by Utkarsh**.  
Particles respond to hand gestures, rotation, pinch zoom, and real-time audio or beat input. Users can switch between presets or upload a custom image to generate dynamic particle formations inside a clean minimal interface.

## ✨ Features

- Hand gesture control (pinch zoom, rotation)
- Audio and beat-reactive particle motion
- Preset particle templates:
  - Heart
  - Saturn
  - Stars
  - Fireworks
- Upload custom image → convert into particle formation
- Live particle color picker
- Sound on/off toggle
- Smooth, real-time interaction
- Minimal modern UI

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Three.js** renders and animates the particle system.
- **Tensorflow.js Hands** tracks gestures from the camera.
- **Web Audio API** analyzes loudness and beat spikes.
- Gesture and audio values update a shared interaction state.
- The animation loop reads this state to transform particles.
